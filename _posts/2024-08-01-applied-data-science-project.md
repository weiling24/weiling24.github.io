## Project Background
Provide an overview of your team's project business goals and objectives and state the objective that you are working on. 

Research Questions
This study addresses two critical research questions in digital mental health:

Do individuals who spend more time on social media platforms show higher mental health risk levels?
Can we predict mental health risk based on digital usage patterns and demographic characteristics?

Dataset

Source: Social Media and Mental Health (SMMH) dataset
Sample Size: 481 participants
Features: 21 variables including demographics, social media usage patterns, and psychological indicators
Target: Mental health risk level (Low, Medium, High) derived from 12 Likert-scale psychological assessment questions

## Work Accomplished
Document your work done to accomplish the outcome

### Data Preparation
We're working with our cleaned SMMH dataset, using all engineered features as predictors and our derived risk_level as the target variable. Our train-test split follows standard machine learning practices with an 80-20 split, stratified sampling to maintain class proportions, and a fixed random state for reproducibility
