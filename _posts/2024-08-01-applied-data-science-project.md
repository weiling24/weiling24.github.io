## Project Background
Our project aims to develop a data-driven approach to understanding and predicting mental health risks associated with social media usage. The primary business objective is to create actionable insights for healthcare providers, policymakers, and individuals to make informed decisions about digital wellbeing. This analysis supports the growing need for evidence-based interventions in the digital mental health landscape, where traditional assessment methods may miss critical risk factors related to online behavior


**Primary Objective** Develop machine learning models that can reliably identify individuals at risk for mental health issues based on their social media usage patterns, enabling early intervention and targeted
support services.

**Research Questions**
This study addresses two critical research questions in digital mental health:
1) Do individuals who spend more time on social media platforms show higher mental health risk levels?
2) Can we predict mental health risk based on digital usage patterns and demographic characteristics?

**Dataset**

- Source: Social Media and Mental Health (SMMH) dataset
- Sample Size: 481 participants
- Features: 21 variables including demographics, social media usage patterns, and psychological indicators
- Target: Mental health risk level (Low, Medium, High) derived from 12 Likert-scale psychological assessment questions

## Work Accomplished
Document your work done to accomplish the outcome

### Data Preparation
We're working with our cleaned SMMH dataset, using all engineered features as predictors and our derived risk_level as the target variable. Our train-test split follows standard machine learning practices with an 80-20 split, stratified sampling to maintain class proportions, and a fixed random state for reproducibility
